            <p>
                I am currently a student at Kirkwood Community College specializing in
                Computer Software Development. My expected time of graduation is around
                2022. Recently I have taken a specific interest in Web Development thanks
                to an Introduction to Web Development class that I am taking at school,
                so this about page is intended to act as a side project to help further
                my understanding of HTML, CSS, and hopefully eventually Javascript.
                Until then, expect sloppy code and many rudimentary mistakes that you
                would come to expect from a fledling programmer and web designer.
            </p>

                Known Languages:
            </h2>
            <p>
                Currently I have a fair understanding of Python, Java, HTML, and CSS.
                I intend on adding more languages to my knowledge base as time progresses.
